This repository utilizes **Yarn Workspaces** to efficiently manage the monorepo structure. It contains two primary sub-projects:
	1. **frontend**: The user interface and client-side logic.
	2. **functions**: Serverless functions hosted on Firebase, serving as the backend for this project.

By organizing the codebase in this way, the monorepo ensures better collaboration and dependency management across both sub-projects.
